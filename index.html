    <h1>Cybersecurity Tips</h1>
    <h2>Avoid OSINT Leaks</h2>
    <p>What even is OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) and why is it leaking?
      According to Wikipedia, "Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources (covert sources and publicly available information (PAI)) to produce actionable intelligence."
      Sounds serious right? Basically what they mean is anything you put out in the world that other people might have access to can be used to identify you and track you. Whenever you post on social media about an event you're at while you are at the event then anyone who sees that post knows at a minimum where you are. Information like this can also be extrapolated to gather what you are interested in, the fact that your home may be unwatched, and what your route back to your home might be in the near future. When you post a picture online it is possible that that picture might contain gps information for where the photo was taken as well as timestamps which can be used to create a history of your activities and where you like to go. To avoid having your private information collected through publicly available data you have to pay attention to privacy settings in the software and websites you use, avoid software and websites from unethical companies and individuals and decide if it's really worth letting people know everything about you just for the "likes" and attention.
